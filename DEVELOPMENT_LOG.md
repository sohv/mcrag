# Multi-LLM Code Review System - Setup & Development Log

## Project Overview

This document captures the complete setup and development process for a Multi-LLM Code Review System that uses three different AI models (Gemini 2.0 Flash, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek R1) to provide comprehensive code reviews with human feedback integration.

## Initial Analysis & Backend Updates

### Backend Architecture Analysis

The system was built using **FastAPI** with the following core components:

1. **API Layer** (`server.py`) - RESTful API with CORS support
2. **Data Models** (`models.py`) - Pydantic models for type safety
3. **Workflow Engine** (`review_workflow.py`) - Orchestrates the multi-LLM review process
4. **LLM Services** (`llm_services.py`) - Integrates with multiple LLM providers
5. **Storage Layer** - Redis for in-memory session and data storage

### Key Features Identified

**Strengths:**
- Async/await throughout for performance
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Parallel LLM processing for efficiency
- Structured conflict resolution system
- Type safety with Pydantic models
- Flexible programming language support
- Human-in-the-loop feedback capability

**Multi-LLM Review Process:**
1. **Coder Phase** (Gemini 2.0 Flash): Initial code analysis and suggestions
2. **Critic Phase** (Parallel execution):
   - **Critic 1** (GPT-4o): Technical accuracy validation
   - **Critic 2** (DeepSeek): Maintainability and practical considerations
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Analyzes disagreements between LLMs
4. **Consensus Generation**: Creates final recommendations

## DeepSeek R1 Integration Update

### Problem Statement
User requested to replace the existing DeepSeek model with DeepSeek R1 for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Backend Updates

**File: `backend/review_workflow.py`**
```python
# Updated LLM model reference
llm_model="deepseek-r1",  # Updated model name
```

**File: `backend/llm_services.py`**
```python
# Updated service comments and model configuration
"""Get feedback from critic LLMs (OpenAI or DeepSeek R1)."""

# Updated model instantiation
).with_model("deepseek", "deepseek-r1")  # Use DeepSeek R1 model

# Updated error handling
logger.warning("DeepSeek R1 not available, falling back to OpenAI")
```

**Enhanced System Prompt for DeepSeek R1:**
```python
Your role is CRITIC 2 (powered by DeepSeek R1). You will review both the original code and the CODER's suggestions from a different perspective, leveraging advanced reasoning capabilities.

Guidelines:
1. Focus on maintainability, team collaboration, and long-term codebase health
2. Consider the business context and practical implementation challenges
3. Evaluate code documentation and clarity aspects
4. Assess testing considerations and error handling
5. Review the coder's suggestions for real-world applicability
6. Consider alternative approaches or architectural patterns
7. Apply deep reasoning to identify subtle issues or improvements
```

#### 2. Documentation Updates

**File: `test_result.md`**
- Updated problem statement to mention DeepSeek R1
- Updated success messages to reference DeepSeek R1
- Updated test comments to reflect model change

**File: `frontend/src/components/ReviewProgress.js`**
```javascript
// Updated LLM label
llm: 'DeepSeek R1'
```

## Frontend Development

### Problem Statement
User needed a simple frontend to test the Multi-LLM code review system, as the backend was not running and the existing frontend needed enhancement.

### Solution Approach

#### 1. Frontend Architecture Enhancement

**Updated `frontend/src/App.js`** with comprehensive workflow management:

```javascript
const CodeReviewApp = () => {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState('submit'); // submit, review, results
  const [submissionId, setSubmissionId] = useState(null);
  const [sessionId, setSessionId] = useState(null);
  const [reviewStatus, setReviewStatus] = useState(null);
  const [reviewData, setReviewData] = useState(null);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  // Real-time status polling
  useEffect(() => {
    let interval;
    if (sessionId && currentStep === 'review') {
      interval = setInterval(async () => {
        try {
          const response = await axios.get(`${API}/review-status/${sessionId}`);
          setReviewStatus(response.data);
          
          if (response.data.status === 'completed') {
            const resultResponse = await axios.get(`${API}/review-result/${sessionId}`);
            setReviewData(resultResponse.data);
            setCurrentStep('results');
            clearInterval(interval);
          }
        } catch (err) {
          console.error('Error checking review status:', err);
        }
      }, 3000); // Check every 3 seconds
    }
    
    return () => {
      if (interval) clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, [sessionId, currentStep]);
```

#### 2. UI Components Integration

**Existing Components Enhanced:**
- `CodeSubmission.js` - Code input form with language selection
- `ReviewProgress.js` - Real-time progress tracking (updated for DeepSeek R1)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
